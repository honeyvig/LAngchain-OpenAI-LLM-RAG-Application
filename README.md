# LAngchain-OpenAI-LLM-RAG-Application


We are seeking a skilled developer with experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI’s LLM models. This project aims to develop a knowledge-based Q&A system that can retrieve information from databases to provide users with accurate and prompt answers to their queries.
=============
To build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI's LLM models, we will use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), database retrieval, and generation from OpenAI's GPT models.

In a RAG system, the key idea is to first retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base (e.g., a database or document) based on the user's query, and then augment the retrieved information with additional insights or context before generating a response.

The following is a Python code implementation using OpenAI's GPT model and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient document retrieval.
Step-by-Step Guide
Prerequisites

Make sure to install the necessary libraries:

    openai: for accessing OpenAI models.
    faiss-cpu: for efficient similarity search.
    transformers: for pre-trained language models.
    numpy: for handling arrays.

pip install openai faiss-cpu transformers numpy

Step 1: Import Required Libraries

import openai
import faiss
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Initialize tokenizer and model from Hugging Face for embeddings
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embedding_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

Step 2: Function for Embedding Text

You need to convert both the query and the documents into embeddings (vector representations). Here, we’ll use a pre-trained transformer model for this purpose.

def encode_text(texts):
    """Encodes a list of texts into embeddings."""
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = embedding_model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).numpy()
    return embeddings

Step 3: Initialize FAISS for Document Retrieval

FAISS allows us to efficiently perform similarity searches. We will store document embeddings in a FAISS index and use it to retrieve the most relevant documents based on the user's query.

def initialize_faiss_index(documents):
    """Initializes a FAISS index to store document embeddings and perform similarity search."""
    document_embeddings = encode_text(documents)
    
    # Initialize the FAISS index
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(document_embeddings.shape[1])  # L2 distance
    index.add(np.array(document_embeddings, dtype=np.float32))
    
    return index, document_embeddings

Step 4: Query Retrieval and Document Similarity

When a user submits a query, we first encode the query into an embedding and then retrieve the most similar documents from the FAISS index.

def retrieve_similar_documents(query, index, documents, k=3):
    """Retrieve the most similar documents to the query."""
    query_embedding = encode_text([query])
    
    # Perform the similarity search in the FAISS index
    D, I = index.search(np.array(query_embedding, dtype=np.float32), k)
    
    # Return the top k documents
    similar_documents = [documents[i] for i in I[0]]
    return similar_documents

Step 5: Use OpenAI’s GPT for Augmented Response Generation

Now that we have the top k most similar documents, we can concatenate them and pass them to OpenAI’s GPT model to generate a response that augments the information.

def generate_answer_with_rag(query, similar_documents):
    """Generate a response using OpenAI's GPT-3 model augmented with retrieved documents."""
    # Prepare the context: concatenate the query with the relevant documents
    context = "\n\n".join(similar_documents)
    prompt = f"Given the following information:\n\n{context}\n\nAnswer the question: {query}"
    
    # Generate a response using GPT-3
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Step 6: Putting It All Together

Now we can integrate all the steps into a cohesive function that takes a user’s query and retrieves the most relevant documents, then augments the answer with OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

def rag_system(query, documents, k=3):
    """Main RAG system function."""
    # Initialize FAISS index
    index, _ = initialize_faiss_index(documents)
    
    # Retrieve similar documents
    similar_documents = retrieve_similar_documents(query, index, documents, k)
    
    # Generate the answer augmented with retrieved documents
    answer = generate_answer_with_rag(query, similar_documents)
    
    return answer

Step 7: Example Usage

Now you can use the RAG system to ask questions and get augmented answers from the knowledge base.

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It is one of the most famous landmarks in the world.",
    "The Louvre Museum in Paris is home to thousands of works of art, including the Mona Lisa.",
    "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, standing at 8,848 meters above sea level."
]

# User query
query = "Where is the Eiffel Tower located?"

# Get the augmented answer using the RAG system
answer = rag_system(query, documents, k=3)

print("Answer:", answer)

Explanation of Components:

    Embedding: We use a transformer model (e.g., MiniLM) to create vector representations (embeddings) of both the documents and the query.
    FAISS: We use FAISS for efficient nearest neighbor search to retrieve similar documents based on the query's embedding.
    OpenAI GPT-3: After retrieving the most relevant documents, we pass them to OpenAI’s GPT model, which generates an answer that combines the information from the documents.

Conclusion

This system combines retrieval from a database or document corpus with the powerful generative capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, making it a potent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. You can adjust the parameters (like k for the number of retrieved documents) and experiment with different models or embeddings to fit your specific use case.
